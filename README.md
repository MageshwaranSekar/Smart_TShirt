## About this project

An intelligent T-Shirt capable of detecting a fall (data collected from the attached accelerometer) and notify the central system, aimed at helping elderly person to get help when they fall down. The system is designed to send data to main server through XBee transceivers which is collected by a UDP listener (in a multi-threaded mode) and the data is displayed in a HTML5 Canvas (using TCP listener in multi-threaded mode).

## TODO

Since this is a project developed during my studies in a French University, some of the functions are named in French. Thus, those functions need to be translated to English.
